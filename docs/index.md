# Index

This website contains the knowledge acquired during the research and development of a hybrid rocket by the University of Padua students' team.

## Documentation Technology

These pages are written in CommonMark, and thanks to MkDocs they support also LaTeX-style math formulas.

$$ c^* = \frac{I_sg_0}{C_F} = \frac{c}{C_F} = \frac{\sqrt{kRT_1}}{k\sqrt{(\frac{2}{k+1})^{\frac{k+1}{k-1}}}} $$
