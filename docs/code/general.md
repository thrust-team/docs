## Overview

The goal of every script is ether:

- Function of a library to be used by many scripts
- Script that relates many functions and values
- Input/Output for information files
- Showing the results in graphical or tabular form

If your script does not do any of the above, think about what you need it for,
and more importantly about what others will need it for.

## Units

All units must be in the International Standard.
