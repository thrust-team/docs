# THRUST Project Knowledge Documentation
## Objective
While trying to document the work done in the development of the project's product,
it became apparent that there was a need to separate the knowledge learned and the
result of the work targeted to the product's end.

This system attempts to fill the need for an easily writeable and accessible place
for the students to learn and teach the learned skills during the project.

## Result
This system relies on files written in MarkDown that automatically compile into
a webpage thanks to MkDocs.

### Install locally
To install a local documentation compilation system you need to have:
- a Python interpreter
- a Python Package Installer, for example `pip`
- install Material for MkDocs with `python -m pip install mkdocs-material`
- run the `serve-locally.bat` file and open http://localhost:8000/
